# Brute Force Sudoku

This is just something I made for fun in some free time I had.

## Usage

There is no UI.  To input an unsolved sudoku, edit the array `sudoku` near the top of the program (PHP, or C).  Zeroes are blank spaces.

## Compilation

### C

No special compile parameters
```sh
gcc sudoku.c
./a.out
```

### PHP

No compile; interpreted language.

```sh
sudo apt install php-cli
./sudoku.php
```
